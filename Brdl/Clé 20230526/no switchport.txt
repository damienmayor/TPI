Dear Jahanzeb,

In simple language, while configuring a Layer 2 Switch e.g 2960, we need to create VLAN's and provide ip address in VLAN's and then tag the ports in respective VLAN. In this scenario, when there is a need for intervlan communication we do connect a router with the switch and use the command 'IP ROUTING'. We can't configure routing protocols in the switch and so have to use the router for the same purpose.
But in case of a Layer 3 switch e.g 3650, we could use it as a Layer 2 as well as Layer 3 device by simply issuing the command 'SWITCHPORT' or 'NO SWITCHPORT' after entering in the specific port need to be used.
By applying 'SWITCHPORT' command, we configure the port to work as a Layer 2 port and would have to bind it with any particular vlan or could use as a trunk port. And by using 'NO SWITCHPORT' command, we enable the Layer 3 function of the switch, where we could configure an IP ADDRESS against that particular port (just like that of routers) and configure the protocols too.

Here is the configuration example for Layer 2 switchport
Switch#configure terminal
Switch(config)#interface vlan xyz
Switch(config-if)#ip address x.x.x.x x.x.x.x
Switch(config-if)#exit
Switch(config)#interface fastethernet 0/1/1
Switch(config-if)#switchport mode access/trunk
Switch(config-if)#switchport access vlan xyz (any VLAN which you want this port to be part of)
Switch(config-if)#exit

Here is configuration example for Layer 3 switchport
Switch#configure terminal
Switch(config)#interface fastethernet 0/1/1
Switch(config)#no switchport (it does support SWITCHPORT command for Layer 2 functionality)
Switch(config)#ip address x.x.x.x x.x.x.x (same as that of router ports)
Switch(config)#no shut
Switch(config)#exit

Hope it would help you out a bit :)
